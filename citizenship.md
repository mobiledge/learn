The current Governor General of Canada is **Mary Simon**. She was installed as the 30th governor general of Canada on July 26, 2021 ¹. 

The Governor General is the representative of The King in Canada. The role has transformed over time, alongside the evolution of Canada as a sovereign and independent nation. As the country’s oldest public office, the position dates back more than 400 years, to 1608, when Samuel de Champlain fulfilled duties and responsibilities that would eventually become those of modern-day governors general ¹.

I hope this helps!
