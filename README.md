## Rules for Learning
*Iteration: Intuition > Impementation > Organization*
- To learn a Subject, understand & accept that it'll take several iterations each from a different sources
- To learn a Subject, first identify a primary source to learn from (book, mooc, etc) based on complexity
- For each chapter and topic, progress through the 3 levels of learning:
- Learning Level 1 - Intuition : Listen/Read to build **intuition** (this is most important)
- Learning Level 2 - Implementation : Do/Practice/Implement to gain a greater degree of mastery
- Learning Level 3 - Organization: Save/Organize(below). Capture code-snippet/class/protocol-implementation for use in future

*Source: Tutorial > Manual > Advanced*
- To learn a Subject, follow a step-by-step tutorial first. 
- To consolidate the kowledge, follow up with the programming guide/reference type book.   
- To master the subject, finish by reading an 'advanced' book.


## Rules for Organization
- Product Type (App, SAAS, Trading etc) 
- Domain: Repo
- Subject: Page
- Chapter: H2 tag 
- Topic: H4 tag
- Term: H6 tag


## Rules for adding content
- Code Snippets: Only log **verified**, **frequently used** code snippets
- Links: Only log **good** sources in the form of links (not contents)
- Text: Use **consise** & **own words** based on **your** understanding


## Rules for coding
- Make It Work, Make It Right, (Make It Fast?)
- Make it Reuseable


## 48 Ideas in CS
*Build intuition. Enjoy the process*
- Idea 1: Sorting (DS & Algo)
- Idea 2: Searching (DS & Algo)
- Idea 3: Graphs (DS & Algo)


## 48 things all Software Developers must know (a little bit about)
- Thing 1: Git (Version Control)
- Thing 2: GitHub (Version Control)
- Thing 3: Command Line (Unix)
- Thing 3: Bash Scripting (Unix)

## Talking Points

#### Native vs Non-native 

Pros of native:
- Hardware features
- Local stotage
- Menu Bar (Mac)

#### Storyboards vs Code

Pros of SB:
- Less UI & layout code.

Pros of Code: 
- Easy dependency injection via initializers.
