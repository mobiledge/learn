## Languages

- iOS: 
[Objective-C](https://github.com/mobilege/ios-development/blob/master/objective-c.md), 
[**Swift**](https://github.com/mobilege/swift/blob/master/README.md)
- Dynamic:
[Python](https://github.com/mobilege/data-science/blob/master/python.md) 
[Ruby](https://github.com/mobilege/ruby/blob/master/README.md) 
- Functional: 
[Haskell](https://github.com/mobilege/haskell/blob/master/README.md),
[ML Language](https://github.com/mobilege/ml-language/blob/master/README.md)
- Functional - Lisp like: 
[Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)), 
[Racket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)), 
[Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) (JVM, 7L7W, 7CM7W)
- Prototype languages: Javascript, Io (7L7W)
- Concurrent, Distributed, Fault-tolerant: Erlang (7L7W), Elixir (7CM7W *Actors*)
- Logic programming: Prolog (7L7W)


7L7W: Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell

*Learn the dynamic typing that makes Ruby, Python, and Perl so flexible and compelling.\
Understand the underlying prototype system that’s at the heart of JavaScript.\
See how pattern matching in Prolog shaped the development of Scala and Erlang.\
Discover how pure functional programming in Haskell is different from the Lisp family of languages, including Clojure.\
Explore the concurrency techniques that are quickly becoming the backbone of a new generation of Internet applications.\
Find out how to use Erlang’s let-it-crash philosophy for building fault-tolerant systems.\
Understand the actor model that drives concurrency design in Io and Scala.\
Learn how Clojure uses versioning to solve some of the most difficult concurrency problems.*

7ML7W: 

- Factor: composition of functions -  concatenative
- Lua: prototypes
- Elm: reactive
- Elixir: distributed - Erlang virtual machine - Clojure-style macros - syntax of Ruby
- Julia: multicore architectures - Scientific computing
- MiniKanren: logic programs (like Mercury or Prolog)
- Idris: type model - (like Haskell, Agda)

## Rules

#### Rules for Learning
*Watch > Read > Practice > Repeat*
- Understand & accept that it'll take **several iterations** each from a different sources.
- Pick a **primary source** to learn from (book, mooc, etc) based on complexity.
- For each topic, progress through the 3 levels of learning:
- Level 1 - Watch videos etc, aim to build intuition.
- Level 2 - Read books, aim to understand slightly thoroughly & somewhat deeply. 
- Level 3 - Practice/Implement exercises/examples etc to gain a degree of mastery.

*Listen for intuition, Read for understanding, Practice for mastery, Repeat for memory.*

*Everyday, learn something new, and revise something old.*

#### Rules for Organization
- Product Type (App, SAAS, Trading etc) 
- Domain: Repo
- Subject: Page
- Chapter: H2 tag 
- Topic: H4 tag
- Term: H6 tag


#### Rules for adding content
- Text: Use **consise** & **own words** based on **your** understanding
- Code Snippets: Only log **verified**, **frequently used** code snippets
- Links: Only log **good** sources in the form of links (not contents)



#### Rules for coding
- Make It Work, Make It Right, (Make It Fast?)
- Make it Reuseable


## Talking Points

_Move this someplace else_

#### Native vs Non-native 

Pros of native:
- Hardware features
- Local stotage
- Menu Bar (Mac)

#### Storyboards vs Code

Pros of SB:
- Less UI & layout code.

Pros of Code: 
- Easy dependency injection via initializers.
